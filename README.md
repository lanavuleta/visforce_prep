# visforce_prep

## Scripts used to prepare Visforce data for upload into dashboard.

Visforce is an integrated modelling tool developed through Prairie Water. Purposes of the Visforce tool: 1) visualize spatial data from modelling, 2) generate time series plots from time-series modelling data, 3) allow access to underlying data via download.\\
Spatial and time-series data required tidying for upload. Tidying was performed through these scripts.\\
Most of these were written at the beginning of my term before I learned more - they are not as pretty as I would like them to be.
